             <p title="KEC"><b>DRONES</b>
                  Drones are modern and sophisticated technology that have been used in numerous 
fields. Nowadays, many countries use them in exploration, reconnaissance operations, and 
espionage in military operations. Drones also have many uses that are not limited to only 
daily life. For example, drones are used for home delivery, safety monitoring, and others. 
However, the use of drones is a double-edged sword. Drones can be used for positive 
purposes to improve the quality of human lives, but they can also be used for criminal 
purposes and other detrimental purposes. In fact, many countries have been attacked by 
terrorists using smart drones. Hence, drone detection is an active area of research and it 
receives the attention of many scholars.
Advanced drones are, many times, difficult to detect, and hence they, sometimes, 
can be life threatening. Currently, most detection methods are based on video, sound, radar, 
temperature, radio frequency (RF), or Wi-Fi techniques. However, each detection method 
has several flaws that make them imperfect choices for drone detection in sensitive areas. 
Our aim is to overcome the challenges that most existing drone detection techniques face. 
In this thesis, we propose two modeling techniques and compare them to produce an 
efficient system for drone detection. Specifically, we compare the two proposed models by 
investigating the risk assessments and the probability of success for each model.</p>

<pre>Drones recently positioned themselves </pre>as an effective multi-task weapon in 
warfare, and nation states and armed groups have sought to possess them for their 
capabilities to deliver painful blows to enemies at low cost.
Drones are complex technical systems that do not need a pilot inside. But they are 
operated through a pilot located at the guidance station that controls the drone remotely. 
The ground pilot is responsible for controlling it remotely, ensuring that it does not get into 
any accidents, or interfering in emergency situations. The pilot must determine the drone's 
route points, and then the drone directs itself according to these coordinates under the 
guidance of its automatic flight system
Drones are predicted to play main roles in future smart cities, through their use in 
surveillance and protection systems, and for maintaining security. Although drones can be 
used to improve daily lives, malicious organizations can use them to perform physical and 
cyber-attacks on infrastructure, private/public property, and individuals. <strong>Air traffic 
management (ATM) for unmanned systems (UTM)</strong> are essential for ensuring secure and 
collision-free activity for all drone flight use-cases. Consequently, different methods of 
identifying, monitoring and preventing potentially unwanted drone missions are of 
paramount importance for monitoring and ATM systems.
The high availability of small drones has raised the interest of different societal 
actors,as remotely controlled drones can be used in various projects. The widespread use 
of these technologies has generated several privacy/security and protection issues which 
need be resolved through proper monitoring systems capable of dealing with these risks 
(Bisio, Garibotto, Lavagetto, Sciarrone, and Zappatore, 2018). In the current days, drones 
are becoming more hazardous and anyone could become a direct or indirect target. In order 
to prevent these potential hazardous situations, this thesis proposes solutions to overcome 
these issues. <br>Drones can perform their missions based on different technologies. Hence, the 
drone detection systems have to be comprehensive enough to detect drones of any kind. 
However, the current systems often have limitations in their ability to detect the several 
types of drones with malicious missions. To exemplify this, we consider a radar system. In 
such a system, any object that flies within the radar field is detected. Radiation is sent to 
hit the object body and then the signal is returned to the source of the radar to determine 
the object’s location. However, many drones are hard to detect and made up of materials 
such as fiber that make signal reflection very difficult or impossible. Moreover, every 
object that flies over a low range is difficult to detect through radar-based techniques. Also, 
sometimes, it is hard to differentiate between birds and drones. Therefore, in the case of a 
drone attack, our aim is to design a system to defend against the attacke
Malicious actors out there seek to develop drones so that they are difficult to detect,
disable and neutralize their threat. To build a safer world, the good actors must work on 
improving the techniques to detect, counter, and destroy the malicious-built drones.
In order to achieve the goals of this research and address the identified problem, we 
use a descriptive approach that includes a review of previous studies found in the literature
and the methods that relate to the topic of the research. Our research objective is to develop 
detection systems that reduce the research problems and provide feasible ways to address
them. More specifically, we adopt some recent and powerful techniques in machine 
learning such as deep neural networks (DNN). Moreover, we combine a classic detection 
method that is based on radar with DNN to reduce false alarms as well as avoid miss￾detection.
 To this end, later we show the advantages of each system with comparison 
between them to produce an optimal detection system. 
Bisio et al. (2018) submitted a proposal for a Wi-Fi-based statistical fingerprint 
method to drone identification, capable of detecting nearby drone malicious mission risks 
even in the midst of hacking attempts. An observational efficiency test is provided and 
shows that the approach could achieve strong outcomes of detection accuracy in several 
real-life situations, with a significant real positive peak rate of 96%.
Loke (2015) presented a study focused on the services and applications presented 
by airborne computing infrastructure to mobile users. The study discusses many concepts,
for example drones-as-a-service and flying, fly-out infrastructure, as well as focuses on 
data controlling and system configuration problems that are on an increasing growth. The 
surveyed paper clarifies the behavior of large data sets emerging from these applications, 
optimizing the design of airborne and ground infrastructure to provide the best Quality of 
Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE), situation knowledge, usability, 
performance routing, user interaction, and physical analysis drones (Loke, 2015).
Guvenc et al. (2020) studied technologies that rely on ambient radio frequency (RF) 
signals generated from drones, radar systems, acoustic sensors, and computer vision 
methods for recognition of malicious drone systems. Some experimental and early 
simulation outcomes are presented on radar-based range approximation of drones, and 
receding horizon tracking of drones. In addition, the study provided an overview of 
corporate methods that are measured for exclusion of drones (Guvenc, Ozdemir, Yapici, 
Mehrpouyan and Matolak, 2020).
According to Kaleem and Rehmani (2018) new suggested solutions coming from 
research and development arena advocate for the introduction of onboard drone detection 
systems. These solutions could make a link between the Monitoring Drone (MDr) and 
Intruder Drone (IDr) concepts. 
Drone Detection Methods
The surveyed literature identified different techniques for detecting and tracking 
intruding drones, such as RF sensing (Nguyen et al., 2018), Wi-Fi sniffing (Bisio et al., 
2019), acoustic sensors (Guvenc et al., 2017), video surveillance (Sturdivant and Chong, 
2017), and radar systems (Birch, Griffin, and Erdman, 2015). The following sections focus 
on the latest methods used to detect drones in larger detail.
Video-based detection uses both graphical and electrical camera sensors to 
recognize moveable objects in the monitored environment. Generally, advertisement 
cameras can achieve an operating range of approximately 350 ft., which leads to a quiet 
desirable neighborhood of monitoring. This method uses characteristics like color, contour 
lines, shapes, and edges to categorize a typical drone’s object as compared to other things 
(Zhang et al., 2016). 
Remote monitoring algorithms can also be used for evaluating elements over 
consecutive frames (Ganti and Kim, 2016). This can help identify different objects with 
identical shapes through their usual gestures, like drones and birds (for example, 
differentiating between artificial drone motions vs. natural bird motions). Cameras 
mounted on these systems are also very sensitive to the lighting conditions and require that 
the target is in their line of sight to be able to detect flying objects. Furthermore, numerous 
studies and research have contributed to the development of a system for the detection and 
identification of drones from surveillance videos (Ganti and Kim, 2016; Wu et al., 2018). 
Sound-Based Detection
Many recent studies and research have focused on the use of the voice detection 
method to detect and identify drones through tools such as correlation analysis (Mezei and 
Molnar, 2016; Mezei, Fiaska, and Molnar, 2015). One of the leading methods that can be 
used in detecting, recognizing acoustics, and distinguishing between drones and other 
objects is the learning algorithm utilized in support vector machines (SVM) (Bernardini, 
Mangiatordi, Pallotti, and Capodiferro, 2017). Nijim and Mantrawadi (2016) presented a 
study to detect drones through their emission sounds. Other works used sound cameras and 
direction of arrival (DOA) rating for classification and tracking of drones (Chang et al., 
2018; Busset et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2018)</p>
